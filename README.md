As for me! I don't speak English very well, 
I am an ordinary person from China. 
One night, I discovered the fun of making programs, 
so I decided to make a unique wallpaper software, 
which is full of my memories. 

Every night, I sit in front of the computer, 
and talk about our dreams with Copilot. 
In today's technologically advanced world, 
we thank everyone who has contributed to science, 
they have brought me closer to my dream and further. 

I am just a lucky star among the stars in the sky, 
live in the present and move forward for my dream. 
Now, now, I have realized my dream, 
I hope to share the joy of this moment with you. 

I decided to release it publicly, 
to accompany everyone with a warm heart, 
this is the best memory in our lives! 

Thank you, hard-working people, 
move forward for your dream!
